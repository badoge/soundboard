I upload new samples every month or so. Some samples might get renamed or moved to a different category after each update.

# forsen

You can easily listen to the samples using [forsen.horse/soundboard](https://forsen.horse/soundboard/)

Most of the samples are recorded by me :) 

but some of them are submitted by:
